## Implementation Approach Analysis Prompt

You are tasked with implementing a solution for the ticket described above. Your goal is to create a comprehensive, actionable plan that:

1. **Analyzes Requirements:** Break down what needs to be done, identify acceptance criteria, and clarify any ambiguities.

2. **Considers Architecture:** Think about:

   - How this validation task fits into the overall CI/CD strategy
   - What testing scenarios will provide the most confidence
   - How to systematically verify all CI components

3. **Evaluates Implementation Options:** Consider different approaches to:

   - Creating an effective test PR
   - Triggering different cache scenarios (hit/miss)
   - Measuring CI performance and reliability
   - Documenting results for future reference

4. **Addresses Testing Strategy:** Plan how to:

   - Verify browser installation works correctly
   - Confirm Storybook a11y tests execute successfully
   - Test cache behavior in different scenarios
   - Ensure no regression in existing functionality

5. **Identifies Risks:** Consider:

   - What could go wrong during validation
   - Edge cases that might be missed
   - How to ensure comprehensive coverage
   - Rollback strategy if issues are found

6. **Plans Implementation Steps:** Create a logical sequence of:
   - Setting up the test environment
   - Creating test scenarios
   - Executing validation tests
   - Analyzing and documenting results

The plan should be practical, testable, and aligned with the project's development philosophy, particularly around CI/CD best practices and quality gates.
