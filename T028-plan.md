# T028: Implement Scroll Reveal Animations for Sections

## Implementation Approach

After analyzing the requirements and consulting multiple perspectives, I will implement scroll reveal animations using a reusable wrapper component that aligns with the project's development philosophy.

## Core Strategy

Create a reusable `ScrollReveal` component using Framer Motion that:
- Wraps section content to provide consistent scroll animations
- Respects accessibility preferences (prefers-reduced-motion)
- Maintains performance with 60fps animations
- Follows the atomic design pattern

## Implementation Details

### 1. Create ScrollReveal Component

Location: `components/animation/ScrollReveal.tsx`

Features:
- Use Framer Motion's `motion.div` with viewport detection
- Initial state: `{ opacity: 0, y: 20 }`
- Animate to: `{ opacity: 1, y: 0 }`
- Duration: 200ms (as specified)
- Trigger once when 25% visible
- Respect prefers-reduced-motion

Props:
- `children`: React.ReactNode
- `yOffset?`: number (default: 20)
- `duration?`: number (default: 0.2)
- `delay?`: number (default: 0)
- `className?`: string

### 2. Apply to Sections

Wrap the following sections in `app/page.tsx`:
- FeaturesSection
- HowItWorksSection
- TestimonialsSection
- CTASection

Note: HeroSection will not have scroll animation (already has page load fade-in)

### 3. Testing Strategy

1. Create a Storybook story for ScrollReveal
2. Manual testing with browser scroll
3. Test with prefers-reduced-motion enabled
4. Verify performance with browser dev tools
5. Test on different viewport sizes

### 4. Accessibility Considerations

- Use Framer Motion's `useReducedMotion` hook
- Disable animations when prefers-reduced-motion is set
- Ensure content is accessible without animations
- No loss of functionality when animations are disabled

### 5. Performance Optimizations

- Use `once: true` to animate only on first visibility
- Optimize with CSS transforms (opacity, translateY)
- Avoid layout-affecting properties
- Keep animations under 200ms for responsiveness

## File Changes

1. Create `components/animation/ScrollReveal.tsx`
2. Modify `app/page.tsx` to import and use ScrollReveal
3. Create `components/animation/ScrollReveal.stories.tsx` for Storybook
4. No changes needed to individual section components

## Success Criteria

- Sections fade in with subtle upward movement on scroll
- Animations are 200ms duration
- Animations respect prefers-reduced-motion
- No performance degradation (60fps maintained)
- Code follows TypeScript best practices
- Reusable component for future use
