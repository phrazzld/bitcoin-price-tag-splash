# T017: Implement Content and Grid for FeaturesSection.tsx

## Task Classification: Simple

## Implementation Plan

Based on PLAN.md requirements, I will update the FeaturesSection component to include a responsive grid with three FeatureCard components.

## Requirements

1. Use Container component (already implemented)
2. Implement a responsive grid with:
   - 3 columns on desktop (grid-column: span 4)
   - 1 column on mobile (grid-column: span 12)
3. Display three FeatureCard components with content:
   - "Instant conversion"
   - "Works everywhere"
   - "Always current"

## Technical Implementation

1. **Grid Structure**:
   - Use CSS Grid with 12-column layout
   - Mobile-first approach
   - Responsive breakpoints using Tailwind

2. **Feature Content**:
   ```
   Feature 1:
   - Icon: Clock or Zap (instant)
   - Title: "Instant conversion"
   - Description: "See Bitcoin values in real-time as you browse"
   
   Feature 2:
   - Icon: Globe (everywhere)
   - Title: "Works everywhere"
   - Description: "Compatible with all major shopping sites"
   
   Feature 3:
   - Icon: TrendingUp or RefreshCw (current)
   - Title: "Always current"
   - Description: "Live exchange rates updated continuously"
   ```

3. **Implementation Code**:
   - Import FeatureCard component
   - Create features array with icon, title, description
   - Map over features to render FeatureCard components
   - Apply grid classes for responsive layout

## Testing Plan

1. Verify grid layout at different breakpoints
2. Check content rendering in each FeatureCard
3. Test responsive behavior (3 cols desktop, 1 col mobile)
4. Verify icon display and text alignment
