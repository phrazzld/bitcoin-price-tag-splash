# T041 Plan: Fix Type-Aware Rule Violations

## Task Classification

**Complex**: This task involves multiple file changes across the codebase to address type-aware ESLint rule violations, primarily focusing on adding return types to functions. The changes span a significant number of files and require careful consideration of appropriate return types.

## Implementation Approach

1. **Fix `explicit-module-boundary-types` warnings**:

   - Add proper return types to all React component functions in page files
   - Focus on the 27 warnings in the ESLint output related to missing return types
   - Use appropriate React/Next.js return types for components

2. **Fix any remaining type-aware rule violations**:

   - Check for and fix any `no-floating-promises` and `no-misused-promises` errors
   - Ensure all functions have proper type definitions

3. **Testing Strategy**:
   - After fixing each group of components, run ESLint to verify improvements
   - Regularly run the application in development mode to ensure changes don't break functionality

## Considerations

- For React components, we'll use appropriate return types like `React.ReactNode`, `JSX.Element`, or `React.FC`
- For Next.js page components, we'll use the appropriate Next.js types
- After making changes, we'll run ESLint to confirm all type-aware rule violations are fixed
- We'll organize our changes by component type for better readability and easier review
