## Title

Fix focus indicator visibility during animations

## Original Ticket Text

- [ ] Review all animated components for focus states
- [ ] Add explicit z-index for focus indicators
- [ ] Ensure outline/border visibility during transforms
- [ ] Verify keyboard navigation works smoothly

## Implementation Approach Analysis Prompt

This task requires fixing focus indicator visibility issues that can occur during CSS animations and transforms. When elements are animated or transformed, focus outlines can sometimes be hidden, clipped, or rendered behind other elements, creating accessibility issues for keyboard users.

Key considerations:

1. Review all components that have animations or transforms to identify focus visibility issues
2. Implement proper z-index stacking contexts to ensure focus indicators are always visible
3. Ensure that transforms don't clip or hide focus outlines
4. Verify that keyboard navigation remains smooth and predictable during animations
5. Test across different browsers as focus outline rendering can vary
6. Follow WCAG 2.1 AA guidelines for focus visibility (2.4.7 Focus Visible)
7. Maintain visual design while ensuring accessibility
