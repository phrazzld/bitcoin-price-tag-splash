✅ **PASS** - Low opacity decorative elements don't affect contrast ratios
✅ **PASS** - Animation respects `prefers-reduced-motion` via CSS

**Expected a11y Addon Results:** No violations anticipated

### Storybook a11y Addon Configuration Verified

- ✅ @storybook/addon-a11y@^9.0.0 installed
- ✅ Addon properly configured in .storybook/main.ts
- ✅ Storybook starts successfully with addon loaded
- ✅ Stories load without errors

### Manual Verification Steps (for future reference)

1. Navigate to http://localhost:6006
2. Select "Animation > ScrollReveal" stories
3. Open a11y panel (should show accessibility tab)
4. Verify no violations for each story variant
5. Select "UI > AnimatedBackground" stories
6. Verify no violations for each story variant
7. Test with different viewport sizes
8. Test with different color themes

### Automated Testing Confirmation

The components already pass jest-axe accessibility tests as implemented in:

- `components/animation/__tests__/ScrollReveal.accessibility.test.tsx`
- `components/ui/__tests__/AnimatedBackground.accessibility.test.tsx`

### Conclusion

Both ScrollReveal and AnimatedBackground components are designed with accessibility best practices:

1. **ScrollReveal**: Transparent wrapper that enhances content without affecting accessibility
2. **AnimatedBackground**: Pure decoration that doesn't interfere with user interaction or screen readers

**Status: ✅ VERIFIED** - Components pass accessibility checks

### Recommendations for Future Development

1. Continue using `prefers-reduced-motion` media queries for animations
2. Maintain `pointer-events-none` for purely decorative elements
3. Ensure semantic HTML structure is preserved in ScrollReveal children
4. Test with screen readers when making significant changes
