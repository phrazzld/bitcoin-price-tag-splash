# T043 Plan: Review and Remove/Justify Suppression Comments

## Context
The Development Philosophy emphasizes addressing violations rather than suppressing them. This task involves finding and properly handling any suppression comments in the codebase.

## Approach

1. Perform a comprehensive search for all types of suppression comments, including:
   - `// eslint-disable`
   - `// eslint-disable-line`
   - `// eslint-disable-next-line`
   - `@ts-ignore`
   - `@ts-expect-error`

2. For each suppression comment found:
   - Examine the underlying issue that required the suppression
   - Determine if the issue can be fixed (preferable approach)
   - If the issue cannot be fixed, add a clear justification comment explaining why the suppression is necessary

3. Document any patterns found to help prevent future unnecessary suppression comments

## Implementation Steps

1. Use grep/search tools to find all instances of suppression comments
2. Create a detailed list of all occurrences
3. Review each occurrence and handle appropriately by either:
   - Fixing the underlying issue and removing the suppression
   - Adding clear justification comment for any remaining suppressions
4. Verify that all remaining suppressions are well-documented with justifications
