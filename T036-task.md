## Title

Add ARIA attributes for animated elements

## Original Ticket Text

- [ ] Identify components needing ARIA labels
- [ ] Add aria-live regions for dynamic content
- [ ] Implement proper role attributes
- [ ] Ensure state changes are announced

## Implementation Approach Analysis Prompt

This task requires implementing comprehensive ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) attributes for animated elements throughout the application. ARIA attributes help assistive technologies understand the purpose, state, and behavior of dynamic content, which is especially important for animated elements that change over time.

Key considerations:

1. Identify all animated components that convey information or state changes
2. Determine appropriate ARIA labels, roles, and properties for each component
3. Implement aria-live regions for content that updates dynamically
4. Ensure animations and state changes are properly announced to screen readers
5. Follow WCAG 2.1 guidelines for programmatic accessibility
6. Consider the semantic meaning of animations (decorative vs informational)
7. Avoid over-labeling while ensuring critical information is accessible
8. Test with actual screen reader software to verify implementation
