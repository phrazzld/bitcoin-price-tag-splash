# T024 CI Analysis Results

## Phase 1: Playwright Installation Fix

### Issue Identified

- **Error**: `Command "playwright" not found`
- **Root Cause**: Playwright was only available as transitive dependency
- **Solution**: Added playwright as direct dev dependency
- **Result**: ✅ Browser installation step now succeeds

### CI Performance (Initial Run - Cache Miss)

- **Total Duration**: ~2m3s
- **Cache Status**:
  - pnpm cache: MISS
  - Playwright cache: MISS
- **Browser Installation**: Successfully downloaded Chromium
- **Build Steps**: All passed

## Phase 2: Storybook Test Results

### Test Execution Summary

- **Total Test Suites**: 5
- **Passed**: 4
- **Failed**: 1 (AnimatedBackground.stories.tsx)
- **Test Cases**: 19 total (17 passed, 2 failed)

### Analysis

The CI pipeline is now functioning correctly with browser installation working as expected. However, there are accessibility test failures in the AnimatedBackground component stories that need to be addressed separately.

### Key Observations

1. **Browser Installation**: ✅ Works correctly with direct playwright dependency
2. **Cache Implementation**: ✅ Configured correctly (cache miss on first run as expected)
3. **CI Pipeline Steps**: ✅ All steps execute in correct order
4. **Storybook Build**: ✅ Builds successfully
5. **A11y Tests**: ⚠️ Execute but have failures in AnimatedBackground

### Performance Baseline (Cache Miss)

- Install dependencies: ~33s
- Build: ~15s
- Install Playwright browsers: ~8s
- Build Storybook: ~20s
- Run Storybook a11y tests: ~7s

## Phase 3: Cache Hit Test Results

### Test Execution

- **Change**: Added comment to README.md
- **Expected**: Cache hits for both pnpm and playwright
- **Actual**: Cache misses for both caches
- **Duration**: ~3m6s (similar to initial run)

### Analysis

The caches are not being restored as expected. This could be due to:

1. Cache not being saved in failed CI runs
2. Different cache keys between runs
3. GitHub Actions cache limitations

### Investigation Needed

- Check if caches are only saved on successful runs
- Verify cache key consistency
- Consider adjusting cache strategy

## Phase 4: Dependency Change Test

### Test Execution

Testing partial cache invalidation by updating a dependency.

### Current Status

- CI infrastructure is working correctly
- Browser installation succeeds
- A11y tests execute but have failures
- Cache behavior needs investigation

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate**: Fix AnimatedBackground a11y failures to get CI passing
2. **Short-term**: Investigate cache save/restore behavior
3. **Long-term**: Document cache requirements and limitations
