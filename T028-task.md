# T028-task

**Task ID:** T028

**Title:** implement scroll reveal animations for sections

**Original Ticket Text:**
- **Context:** PLAN.md > Animations > Scroll; Phase 4: Assembly (2)
- **Action:**
  1. Use Framer Motion to apply simple reveal animations (e.g., fade in, slight upward move) to sections as they scroll into view.
  2. Animation duration should be around 200ms.
- **Done‑when:**
  1. Sections animate into view subtly as the user scrolls down the page.
- **Verification:**
  1. Scroll up and down the page to observe reveal animations on sections.
- **Depends‑on:** [T002, T026]

**Implementation Approach Analysis Prompt:**

Based on the task description, design context, and codebase structure, provide a comprehensive implementation approach that:

1. Identifies all components that need scroll animations
2. Recommends the best Framer Motion approach for scroll-triggered animations
3. Considers performance implications and best practices
4. Addresses accessibility concerns (prefers-reduced-motion)
5. Proposes a reusable solution to avoid code duplication
6. Ensures animations align with the design philosophy (subtle, 200ms duration)
7. Considers viewport detection and animation trigger points
8. Plans for testing and verification of animations

Consider the following:
- Which sections should have scroll animations?
- Should we create a reusable animation wrapper component?
- How to handle animation state and viewport detection?
- What animation properties should be animated (opacity, y position)?
- How to ensure smooth performance on various devices?
