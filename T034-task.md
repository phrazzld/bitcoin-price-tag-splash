## Title

Implement prefers-reduced-motion support

## Original Ticket Text

- [ ] Audit all CSS animations in the codebase
- [ ] Add @media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) queries
- [ ] Provide static or minimal animation alternatives
- [ ] Test with reduced motion preference enabled

## Implementation Approach Analysis Prompt

This task requires implementing comprehensive support for the `prefers-reduced-motion` CSS media query across all animated components in the codebase. The goal is to respect user accessibility preferences by providing reduced or static alternatives to animations when users have indicated they prefer reduced motion.

Key considerations:

1. Audit all existing CSS animations and transitions
2. Design appropriate reduced-motion alternatives (static states, minimal transitions, or instant changes)
3. Implement media queries that provide these alternatives
4. Ensure animations are not essential for functionality or content understanding
5. Test the implementation with actual reduced motion preferences
6. Maintain visual hierarchy and user experience even with reduced motion
7. Follow WCAG guidelines for motion sensitivity
