# T011: Style Navigation.tsx (fixed, height, background, blur)

## Implementation Plan

Based on the requirements from PLAN.md, I will update the Navigation component styling:

1. Positioning:
   - Apply fixed positioning at the top
   - Set z-index to ensure it stays above other content

2. Height:
   - Set height to 64px (16 in Tailwind = 64px)

3. Background:
   - White background with 95% opacity
   - Add backdrop-blur effect for glassmorphism

4. Styling Implementation:
   - Use Tailwind CSS classes for all styling
   - Fixed position with top-0, left-0, right-0
   - Background: bg-white/95 for 95% opacity
   - Backdrop blur: backdrop-blur-sm or backdrop-blur

5. Responsive Considerations:
   - Ensure styles work across all breakpoints
   - Test with scrollable content to verify fixed positioning
