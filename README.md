# Bitcoin Price Tag Splash Page

A modern splash page for the Bitcoin Price Tag browser extension, built with Next.js, React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.

## Getting Started

This project uses pnpm as the package manager. Other package managers (npm, yarn, bun) are not supported.

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Run development server
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
