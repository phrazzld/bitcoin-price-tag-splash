# Suppression Comments Review

## Overview

As part of task T043, a comprehensive review of all suppression comments in the codebase was conducted. This includes ESLint suppression comments (eslint-disable*) and TypeScript suppression comments (@ts-ignore, @ts-expect-error).

## Findings

After a thorough search of the entire codebase, only one suppression comment was found:

1. **File**: `test-eslint.ts`
   - **Line**: 12
   - **Suppression**: `// eslint-disable-next-line @typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars`
   - **Context**: Test file created specifically to validate ESLint rule configurations
   - **Resolution**: JUSTIFIED with detailed documentation
   - **Justification**: This is an intentional test case for the ESLint rule system. The function is deliberately unused to verify that the ESLint rule for unused variables works correctly.

## Conclusion

The codebase maintains high quality standards with minimal use of suppression comments. The only instance found has been properly justified with clear documentation explaining why the suppression is necessary.

## Recommendations

1. Continue to maintain the current high standard of addressing issues rather than suppressing them
2. When suppressions are absolutely necessary, follow the example in `test-eslint.ts` of providing clear documentation of the justification
3. Consider adding linting rules to enforce that all suppression comments must be accompanied by a justification comment
