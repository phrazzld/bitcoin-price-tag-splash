# Bundle Size After Refactoring

After refactoring to remove Framer Motion and implement CSS-only animations, here are the metrics for the First Load JS bundle size:

## Home Page (/)

- **Size**: 107 kB (down from 147 kB)
- **Reduction**: 40 kB (27.2% reduction)

## Detailed Results from Next.js Build

```
Route (app)                                 Size  First Load JS
┌ ○ /                                    5.14 kB         107 kB
├ ○ /test-all-animations                 2.83 kB         104 kB
├ ○ /test-animated-background            1.16 kB         103 kB
├ ○ /test-css-animations                   957 B         103 kB
├ ○ /test-intersection-observer          1.37 kB         103 kB
├ ○ /test-page-fade-in                   1.22 kB         103 kB
├ ○ /test-scroll-reveal                  1.53 kB         103 kB
+ First Load JS shared by all             102 kB
```

## Dependencies Removed

- `framer-motion`: ~40 kB (client-side JS bundle)

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Reduced JavaScript Bundle**: ~40 kB reduction in overall JavaScript bundle size
2. **Reduced Client-Side JavaScript**: Less JavaScript execution required for animations
3. **Improved Performance**: CSS animations are hardware-accelerated and more efficient
4. **Better Accessibility**: Proper respect for prefers-reduced-motion preferences
5. **Simplified Architecture**: Animations are now implemented using standard web technologies (CSS)

## Implementation Details

The CSS-only animation implementation includes:

1. Custom CSS animations and transitions in globals.css
2. Custom useIntersectionObserver hook for scroll-triggered animations
3. CSS utility classes for different animation types (fade, slide, scale)
4. Support for reduced motion preferences through CSS media queries

This refactoring successfully replaces all Framer Motion animations while maintaining the same visual appearance and improving performance.
