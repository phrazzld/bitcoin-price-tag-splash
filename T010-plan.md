# T010: Create Navigation.tsx Structure

## Implementation Plan

Based on the requirements from PLAN.md for the Navigation section, I will create a Navigation component with the following structure:

1. Component Structure:
   - Basic container with logo on the left and Download CTA on the right
   - Will use Container component for consistent max-width and padding
   - Flexbox layout for horizontal alignment

2. Design Implementation:
   - Follow Swiss Minimalism principles
   - Height: 64px (per design spec)
   - Position: Will be fixed in a later task (T011)
   - Background: Will be styled in a later task (T011)

3. Props Interface:
   - No props needed for this initial structure
   - Component will render placeholder elements for logo and CTA

4. Styling:
   - Use Tailwind CSS for layout and spacing
   - Flexbox with justify-between for logo/CTA positioning
   - Align items center for vertical centering

5. Client Component:
   - Not needed for this initial structure
