# T023: Implement content for CTASection.tsx

## Implementation Plan

1. Add H2 with text "Start seeing Bitcoin prices"
2. Integrate Button component for secondary CTA
3. Since button is mentioned as secondary, use same Button component but consider different text (e.g., "Get Started" or "Install Now")
4. Apply appropriate typography and spacing
5. Ensure content remains centered within the section

## Notes

- The task mentions "secondary CTA button" but Button.tsx currently only has primary styles
- Will use the existing Button component with appropriate text
- May need to adjust layout to match the design intent
