# T021: Implement content for TestimonialsSection.tsx

## Implementation Plan

1. Add a centered quote with placeholder testimonial text
2. Implement large decorative quotation marks styled with Bitcoin Orange (#F7931A)
3. Add author name and title below the quote
4. Ensure all content is properly centered within the section
5. Apply appropriate typography and spacing for the design

## Styling Approach

- Use CSS for the large quotation marks 
- Use opacity for subtle effect on quotation marks
- Quote text should be larger than body text
- Author details should be smaller and slightly faded
- Maintain responsive design patterns
