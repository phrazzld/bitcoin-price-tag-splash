# T024: Create Footer.tsx structure

## Implementation Plan

1. Create `components/sections/Footer.tsx` file
2. Import Container component for consistent layout
3. Create basic React functional component structure
4. Add placeholder comment for content to be added in T025
5. Follow the same pattern as other section components

## Notes

- This is just the structural setup, content will be added in T025
- Container component will provide consistent spacing and layout
- Use footer tag instead of section tag for semantic HTML
