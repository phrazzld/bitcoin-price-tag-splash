# T012: Add content to Navigation.tsx (logo, CTA)

## Implementation Plan

1. Import Button component from components/ui/Button.tsx
2. Replace logo placeholder with proper text for "Bitcoin Price Tag" 
3. Replace CTA placeholder with Button component saying "Add to Chrome"
4. Ensure proper alignment and spacing between logo and CTA

## Considerations

- Use existing Button component with primary styling (Bitcoin orange)
- Keep the logo simple as text for now (no SVG required)
- Maintain the current flex layout for proper spacing
