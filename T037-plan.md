# T037 Plan: Add Formatting and Linting Scripts to package.json

## Task Classification
**Simple**: This task involves a straightforward modification to a single file (package.json) with well-defined requirements.

## Implementation Approach
1. Add the specified scripts to the `scripts` section of package.json:
   - `format:check`: For checking if files are properly formatted
   - `format:write`: For automatically formatting files
   - `lint`: For running ESLint with maximum strictness
   - `lint:fix`: For automatically fixing linting issues where possible

2. Preserve existing scripts while adding the new ones.

3. Verify the scripts work correctly by running each with the `--help` flag.

## Considerations
- Ensure proper syntax for the package.json file
- Verify the commands use the correct patterns for TypeScript and JavaScript files
- Maintain the max-warnings 0 setting as specified to ensure strict linting
