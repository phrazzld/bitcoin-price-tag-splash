# T039 Plan: Perform Initial ESLint Audit

## Task Classification
**Simple**: This task involves running the ESLint tool on the codebase and capturing the output without making any changes to fix the issues.

## Implementation Approach
1. Run `pnpm lint` on the codebase to perform the ESLint audit
2. Capture the output in a log file for reference and future fixing tasks
3. Organize and categorize the ESLint errors to understand patterns and common issues
4. Document the findings for easy reference in subsequent tasks (T040, T041, T042)

## Considerations
- This is an audit task, not a fix task - we're only collecting information at this stage
- The output will be used to guide the implementation of T040, T041, and T042
- We need to make sure we capture all errors, including type-aware rule violations
- We should be particularly looking for `any` type usage, which will be addressed in T040
