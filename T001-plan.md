# T001 Implementation Plan

## Task: Install Pino and UUID dependencies for structured logging

### Approach

Following DEVELOPMENT_PHILOSOPHY_APPENDIX_TYPESCRIPT.md dependency management principles:

1. **Use pnpm consistently** - Already enforced by preinstall script
2. **Add production dependency:** `pino` for logging library
3. **Add dev dependencies:** `@types/uuid` and `uuid` for correlation ID generation
4. **Maintain clean package.json** - Dependencies will be added to appropriate sections
5. **Commit lock file changes** - pnpm-lock.yaml will be updated and committed

### Implementation Steps

1. Run `pnpm add pino` - Adds Pino logging library as production dependency
2. Run `pnpm add -D @types/uuid uuid` - Adds UUID generation capability with TypeScript types
3. Verify dependencies appear in package.json with correct categorization
4. Test import resolution to ensure TypeScript can find the packages

### Success Criteria

- `pino` listed in dependencies section of package.json
- `uuid` and `@types/uuid` listed in devDependencies section
- pnpm-lock.yaml updated with new package information
- TypeScript import statements resolve without errors
- No dependency conflicts or installation errors
