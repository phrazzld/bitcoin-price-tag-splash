# T029: Perform responsive adjustments across all breakpoints

## Implementation Approach

Implement a systematic, component-by-component responsive review and adjustment using Tailwind CSS. The approach will focus on mobile-first design, ensuring optimal layout and usability across all breakpoints while maintaining visual hierarchy and accessibility.

## Testing Strategy

### Breakpoints to Test
- Mobile: 320px, 375px, 414px (up to 768px)
- Tablet: 768px - 1024px
- Desktop: 1024px+
- Large Desktop: 1280px+

### Components to Test
1. Navigation
2. HeroSection
3. FeaturesSection
4. HowItWorksSection
5. TestimonialsSection
6. CTASection
7. Footer
8. UI Components (Button, Container, FeatureCard, StepCard)

## Testing Checklist

For each component at each breakpoint, check for:
- [ ] Horizontal overflow/scrolling
- [ ] Text clipping or illegibility
- [ ] Grid/flex layout issues
- [ ] Proper spacing and padding
- [ ] Touch target sizes (minimum 44x44px)
- [ ] Image scaling and contain
- [ ] Visual hierarchy preservation
- [ ] Typography scaling
- [ ] Container widths and centering

## Common Responsive Patterns

### Grid Adjustments
- Mobile: `col-span-12`
- Tablet: `md:col-span-6`
- Desktop: `lg:col-span-4`

### Typography Scaling
- Mobile: `text-base`
- Tablet: `md:text-lg`
- Desktop: `lg:text-xl`

### Spacing Patterns
- Mobile: `py-8`, `px-4`
- Tablet: `md:py-12`, `md:px-6`
- Desktop: `lg:py-16`, `lg:px-8`

### Flex Layout
- Mobile: `flex-col`
- Desktop: `md:flex-row`

## Component-Specific Adjustments

### Navigation
- Check fixed positioning and backdrop blur
- Ensure logo and CTA are properly spaced on mobile
- Verify Container width constraints

### HeroSection
- Test animation visibility on all viewports
- Ensure H1 is readable on mobile
- Check CTA button sizing
- Verify centered content max-width

### FeaturesSection
- Grid should stack on mobile (col-span-12)
- 3 columns on desktop (md:col-span-4)
- Check icon and text alignment

### HowItWorksSection
- Steps should stack on mobile
- Horizontal flow on desktop
- Verify screenshot placeholders scale properly

### TestimonialsSection
- Check quote marks positioning
- Ensure text is centered and readable
- Verify max-width constraint

### CTASection
- Center alignment at all breakpoints
- Button sizing and clickability
- H2 typography scaling

### Footer
- Links should wrap appropriately on mobile
- Maintain center alignment
- Check spacing between elements

## Implementation Steps

1. Start development server and open browser dev tools
2. Test each component at 320px, 375px, 414px (mobile)
3. Document issues found for each component
4. Apply Tailwind responsive classes following mobile-first approach
5. Re-test at tablet breakpoints (768px, 1024px)
5. Re-test at desktop breakpoints (1024px+, 1280px+)
6. Verify changes on actual devices if available
7. Ensure all touch targets meet 44px minimum
8. Check focus states and accessibility
9. Run linter to ensure code quality

## Accessibility Considerations

- Maintain color contrast ratios
- Preserve focus indicators
- Ensure touch targets are adequate
- Keep semantic HTML structure
- Test with keyboard navigation
