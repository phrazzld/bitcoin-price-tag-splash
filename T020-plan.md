# T020 Plan: Verify ScrollReveal & AnimatedBackground Pass Storybook a11y Checks

## Classification: Simple

This is a verification task using existing tooling with minimal risk.

## Implementation Approach

### 1. Run Storybook with a11y Addon

- Start Storybook locally to access the a11y addon interface
- Verify the a11y addon is properly loaded and functional

### 2. Test ScrollReveal Stories

- Navigate to each ScrollReveal story in Storybook
- Check the a11y panel for violations
- Document any violations found and their severity
- Fix violations if they exist (likely minor adjustments)

### 3. Test AnimatedBackground Stories

- Navigate to each AnimatedBackground story in Storybook
- Check the a11y panel for violations
- Document any violations found and their severity
- Fix violations if they exist (likely minor adjustments)

### 4. Document Results

- Confirm all stories pass a11y checks
- Note any fixes made during the process

## Expected Outcomes

- ScrollReveal and AnimatedBackground stories should pass a11y checks
- Both components are designed with accessibility in mind (decorative animations, proper ARIA usage)
- Any violations should be minor and easily fixable

## Adherence to Philosophy

- **Automate Everything**: Using automated a11y checks as part of development workflow
- **Design for Testability**: Ensuring components meet accessibility standards from design phase
- **Explicit is Better than Implicit**: Clear documentation of a11y compliance verification

## Success Criteria

- All ScrollReveal stories pass Storybook a11y checks
- All AnimatedBackground stories pass Storybook a11y checks
- Any violations found are documented and fixed
- Verification process is documented
